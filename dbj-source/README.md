# What Are These Source Files?

These `.dbj` source files have been generated using the `makebst` program from the [custom-bib](https://ctan.org/pkg/custom-bib) package. The resulting BibTeX style files (`bst`) serves as a foundation for creating additional bibliography style files within this package.

## How to use `filename.dbj` to create a `filename.bst` file?

To create a `bst` file, open a terminal/command prompt and run the command:

```bash
latex filename.dbj
```

That's it!
